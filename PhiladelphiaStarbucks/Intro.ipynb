    "Starbucks has reached out and they want to open a new location in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. They want to make sure that the location does not have a lot of other coffee shops around so that their new location can be successful. The stakeholders are concerned that if other coffee shops are around the newly opened Starbucks location, that consumers will go to these other shops out of proximity convenience. They also want to make sure that the population density is high in the area that they plan to open the new location. "
